HOUSE is a large real estate agency employing about 20 agents. HOUSE specializes in selling city apartments. HOUSE has two types of customers: those who wish to sell their apartment (sellers) and those who wish to buy an apartment (buyers). HOUSE currently has more than 1000 customers, as well as many  thousands of apartments in its records. HOUSE managers were thinking of expanding their  company to other cities and decided to invest on a system that would support the  centralized management of all their data and the process of selling apartments. They asked the software development company LOGISMIKO to build a system for this purpose. 
The functionality of the desired system is summarized as follows: Each time a new customer (whether a buyer or a seller) visits the agency all personal data is being recorded. Moreover, details of the apartments offered for sale (by sellers) are recorded, as well as, preferences for a requested apartment (by buyers) are recorded. The agent can search the list of available apartments to find the most appropriate apartment for each of their customers. The system presents a list of apartments matching the buyersâ€™ preferences and suggests these to the agents. Buyers then visit some of the apartments to decide whether they are interested in buying them. The system keeps track of all visits and in case the apartments he visited do not satisfy the buyer, these are excluded from future searches. The system also generates a variety of reports: complete lists of apartments sorted by region, short apartment lists for advertisement in newspaper, sold apartments for each agent.
